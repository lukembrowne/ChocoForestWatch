## What is ChocoForestWatch?

ChocoForestWatch is an advanced forest monitoring system that monitors deforestation and forest cover changes across the Choc√≥ bioregion of western Ecuador. Using high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning, we provide researchers, conservationists, and policymakers with the tools needed to protect one of the world's most biodiverse and threatened regions.

## Key Features

üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Mapping Interface** - Explore forest cover changes with an intuitive web-based mapping platform

üõ∞Ô∏è **Satellite Image Analysis** - Monthly NICFI satellite imagery processed with advanced machine learning algorithms

ü§ñ **ML-Powered Detection** - XGBoost models trained on expert-annotated data to identify deforestation patterns
